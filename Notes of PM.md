3. Use models to predict outcomes.
4. Compare prediction results with real outcomes.

## Collect Metrics
1. Detect key parameters of each project
2. Try to measure amount of work and use models to to set up finishing dates.
3. User archive data to map between project size and productivity.
4. Do not forget about deviations.

## Development process
1. It is always good to spent time to make development process effective and optimized.
2. Good employee will concentrate on existing aims and issues, even without notifications.
3. Development quality upgrades will give the result after a long time. So no need to spent a lot of time on such upgrades during work on project.
4. Do not apply more than one quality upgrade at once.
5. Standardized development process is dangerous. Because some routines can be skipped.

## Do things different way
1. There is only one way to reduce development time  - reduce debugging.
2. Projects with detailed architecture needs less time to debug.
3. Almost all bugs appear on edges of modules but not inside module (it should be solved with detailed architecting).

## Pressure from above
1. People do not work faster under pressure.
2. Overtime reduces productivity.
3. Bosses likes to use pressure only if they don’t know how to influence better or other methods looks too complicated. May be pressure is a way to defend yourself in bad situation for them.

3. No-one will tell you that specification is wrong…people will think first that they are not smart enough.

## Conflicts
1. Conflicts are inevitable.
2. Software development process is a hotbed of conflict.

3. First it is good to start with small teams  and add more developers on development phase only (when architecture is designed).
4. Looks like teams that working without strict deadlines finishes their work faster.
